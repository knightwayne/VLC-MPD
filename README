GSoC 2020: Implementing a MPD Module in VLC
Work Done So Far

Created MPD Architecture using MPD protocol as skeleton.
Polling for sampling a set of clients
Parsing Input Commands
Implemented 2 ways of sending data.
Implemented the following sets of Commands for controlling VLC through text-based commands:

Playback Options: consume, repeat, random, single, volume, etc
Controlling Playback: play, pause, next, previous, stop, seek, etc
Queue Control: add (files, folders recursively), delete, move, swap, shuffle, playlist information, playlist information metadata, etc.
Playlists: Saving, loading and modifying playlists from MPD.
Music Database: Not very stable, but basic listing and search/search+add features work fine.
Handling other misc commands: Ping, Idle, Close, etc.



Remaining Features & Issues:

Making the music database more verbose. Adding more tags to be queried by MPD clients.
Advanced Find/Search features so multiple tag filters can be applied at the same time. Currently only one filter can be applied through vlc_query_params.
status and stats commands: can't extract information, input_item_t doesn't grab value as it should.
Memory leaks and testing.
